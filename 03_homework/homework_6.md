It’s important to include considerations of ethics and inequity into data operations. As an example, we can consider Homework-5 SQL tasks to include components of ethics and inequity.

In the CROSS JOIN operation, it's important to consider the ethical implications, while calculating potential earnings for vendors. For example, it’s important to understand the economic impact on different customer demographics to ensure that the pricing strategies do not unfairly disadvantage lower-income groups.

I would suggest making the adjustments holistically for the approach. There should be some process to review the data operations from an ethical & inequity perspective. The review should contain diverse stakeholders. For example, after each product increment completion, during product demo reviews, there might be a questionnaire for the ethics or inequity analysis included.

**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.
